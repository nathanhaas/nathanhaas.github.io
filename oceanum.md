###Chapter 1
“You think they accept middle school keychains as a valid photo ID?”

Theo looked up with a smile on his face, only to see that Felix’ expression was stone cold. The smile vanished as Theo suddenly remembered who he was talking to. “I’m sorry, but you dragged us all the way here and couldn’t be bothered to prepare at least a little?”

Felix scoffed, “Of course I prepared! In this case, preparing just happened to mean grabbing the first photo of myself I saw on the way out the door. Don’t worry about it man, I’ll figure it out.”

Theo sighed and leaned back in his chair. They’d been in this waiting room for a half hour at most, but it felt like so much longer than that. The room they sat in now was much cleaner than he thought it should be, at least considering the crowd it had attracted. White tiled flooring, white walls, white ceiling. He didn’t understand the fascination with white things being cleaner than other colors, but that was beside the point. Felix had wanted to apply at the Reliquary for years, and when the time finally came, he dragged Theo along with him. He was convinced that it was just one of those things Felix had become fascinated with when he was younger and latched on to for no real reason. At least then he was interested in things he knew he couldn’t do, like being an astronaut or getting a full ride to a private school.

Out of the corner of his eye, Theo noticed a younger gentleman enter from the far end of the room, readjust his tie, and take a moment to sigh. 

“Is there a Felix Kelly here?” he said, more quietly than he should have considering the packed room they were in. “Anyone?”

“One second sir!” Felix called out, waving back to the man. The man did not wave back. “Are you gonna be alright out here Theo?”

“I’m sure I’ll manage. Shouldn’t be too hard—I, at least, have my ID on me.”

Felix scrunched up his face, “I guess we’re gonna be nasty now. But seriously man, thank you for coming with me. It means a lot.” 

As Felix followed the gentleman down the hallway, Theo saw him whip out his keychain and flash a grin. The man shook his head, but kept walking nonetheless. If all went well here, they’d likely be recruited by the Reliquary. It wasn’t necessarily what Theo wanted, but he figured it was the safest way to go about pushing back the Pariah. It was only a few minutes before another older woman in a suit walked out of the hallway, paused, and called out Theo’s name. The woman was short, stocky, and the pure embodiment of the word ‘jolly’. Even the buttons on her bright grey suit looked as if they were about to pop from glee. Her smile was nearly glistening, but Theo did not find it contagious whatsoever. 

“Would you follow me please?” she asked, her voice ringing through the air like church bells. 

Theo groaned, “Of course.” He stood from his chair, grabbing his jacket on the way. As they walked down the hallway, they passed numerous metal doors on either side. He noted how this contributed to the cleanliness aesthetic he had noticed earlier.

“Once we get to our testing room, you’ll be asked a few questions. Just so you know in advance, we’ll be separated by a glass screen,” she said, her face suddenly growing dour, “It’s safety protocol.” Within a moment she had perked right back up again.

“Would you mind if we started that question process now?” “Are you in a hurry? We only accept people that are truly dedicated to helping and supporting the Reliquary.”

Theo chose to ignore this. One more hallway and two flights of stairs led them to the designated testing room. Opening the door revealed two paths that they could take, one with stairs leading to an upper level. The woman directed Theo to go to the left, where she would instead advance up the steps to the right. The room he entered was white, with a metal chair screwed to the ground in the center. Of course it was. At the top of the wall the chair faced was an observatory space with a large clear screen taking up nearly half the wall. Behind it stood the woman who walked him to the room, pacing back and forth. Towards the bottom of the wall was a small opening that looked similar to a mail slot.

The woman’s voice sounded over an intercom, “Alright, let’s start off with the questions. Name?”

“Theo Hargreaves.”

“Age?”

“17.”

“Address?”

“773 Pearbush Avenue.” She paused for a moment, perhaps to think. “And what district would that be in?” The district where you lived mattered more in Erikson than it probably should have, but the variety of districts lead to easy stereotypes. Theo’s district was generally considered to be in the upper end of class, having a history of breeding educated, well read, people. If they weren’t educated or well read, they were rich, which was a fine enough substitution. Just southwest of there was Pariah territory. He had heard it described as being like the Wild West, so there wasn’t exactly much conversation between them and other districts. The Reliquary prided itself on being the one thing standing between the Pariah and complete domination of Erikson. They did prevent chaos, but Theo was skeptical whether domination was really in their purview. Theo smirked. “The northern end of City Government Territory, directly south of here.” 

“Good, good. Always nice to see a face from the CGT.” She took a few seconds to scribble something down on a pad of paper. “Moving on to the more interesting questions! Why did you apply here?”

In all honesty, he wasn’t entirely sure. Of course Felix had wanted them to apply together, and it would give them a way to fight back against the Pariah, but that was astoundingly little motivation when he actually thought about it. He thought of the Reliquary as a group of glorified police officers with way less restriction. They spouted all this nonsense like how they would “keep the people safe” while “preventing conflict” through hunting down anyone they thought might be a threat. To be fair, they did happen to be extremely effective at preventing conflict, and this certainly wasn’t some dystopian society where the Reliquary ruled over everyone else. He supposed he wanted to help the people in the less fortunate districts of Erikson, but he wasn’t entirely sure this was the way to go about doing that. Of course if he wanted the job, he couldn’t tell the woman any of that. 

“I think that the Reliquary does great work for this city and this country, and I’m inspired by you all every day.”

Her smile widened at that. She began to put her papers down, just to scramble to pick them back up again, “I almost forgot! Final question, I promise. Do you know what a Relic is?”

“Of course I do, they teach you about them way back in elementary school,” Theo responded, almost taken aback by the question, “The name of this organization is the Reliquary, Relics aren’t exactly a secret.”

“Perfect. In that case, you’re going to use one.” At that, the mail slot rattled.

Theo was skeptical, at best. Relics were strictly advised against using by everyone including the Reliquary, not to mention how rare they had become. He moved into the middle of the room, leaning on the chair. “Aren’t they dangerous?”

In response, she only knocked on the glass separating the two of them with one hand, pointing down towards the slot with the other. Curiosity tugged at Theo, leading him to open the slot and look inside. Inside, he found a regular old black and white die, the type you would find with any board game. He frowned. “That’s it?”

No response that time. Everything he had heard about Relics before led him to believe they would be more like relics, ancient even. The type of thing a movie star would find at the end of a two hour long treasure hunt. It couldn’t possibly be a real Relic. He went to touch it, hesitated, and then snatched it up anyway.

“So, what do you feel?” the woman asked, reentering the conversation.

Theo backed up from the slot, tossing it from hand to hand. “Exactly the same as usual.”

She scribbled something down on her paper and sighed. “You can go now.”

“Wait, this isn’t even a real Relic though! I’m not supposed to feel anything!”

“Theo, when I said you could leave,” she said, her voice growing more stern, “It was an order, not a suggestion.”

He could feel his frustration building. Without a doubt, he knew the die wasn’t a Relic. The audacity that woman must have to lie about the die, and then tell him to leave when it didn’t do anything. Her cheery expression was gone. “Mr. Hargreaves, leave!”

She began to stomp her way out of the observation area. Theo slid the die into his pocket and moved out of the room to meet the woman at the bottom of the stairs.

Huffing down the stairs, she pointed from Theo, to the door, and back again. Only serving to frustrate Theo more, he stormed out of the room, through the one hallway and down the two flights of stairs back to the waiting room. It was noticeably louder there than it was before, but there wasn’t time to focus on that. He found Felix leaning against the wall at the back end of the room, passing his hand through his slick black hair.

“Hey Theo! I passed my test, man, I’m gonna start working here soon. Those Relic things are so much-“

“Felix, it’s time to go.”

Felix grabbed his belongings and jogged to catch up to Theo, who was already hurrying out. “Fine by me. They said they might even make me front line against the Pariah.”

Theo kept walking. It was even more aggravating that Felix could seemingly use the Relic they gave him when Theo didn’t even get a working one. On top of that, he was turned down where Felix wasn’t.

“Oh man, those Relics. You have to tell me what yours did. Theo?” He just had to rub it in. Theo scowled. “Can we just wait a bit until we talk about this?”

Felix nodded. Walking outside, Theo was eternally grateful to be back out in the open air again. The sights, sounds, and smells of the Reliquary district stood in stark contrast with each other. Where everything looked clean, as if the roads and walls were power washed daily, the district smelled of smoke and sounded of commotion. At least some other areas were more honest than others with how they looked. Looking south towards Pariah territory, he turned over the die in his pocket.


###Chapter Two
He made eye contact with himself in the mirror. Same Theo as he always had been. The same wavy blonde hair, the same ears that stuck out just a little bit further than they should have. He stood the same way as he always had, upright and confident, with his hands tucked into the pockets of his bomber jacket. He smiled, picking out some food from between his teeth where it had always gotten stuck before. The bright red shirt he wore underneath the jacket was baggy, making up for the length of his torso being well above average for his height. Most definitely the same Theo Hargreaves. 

He still doubted it. The real Theo Hargreaves wouldn’t even think of venturing into Pariah territory, let alone want to go because of some die he stole. And yet this Theo Hargreaves did. It had been a little less than a week since he and Felix had gone to the Reliquary together, and it seemed that they were dealing with the outcome in very different ways. Felix was exasperatingly ecstatic that he was accepted to work with the Reliquary. He hadn’t been assigned a position yet, but Theo couldn’t be around him without the topic coming up repeatedly. Felix was insufferable. It was just so rare for Theo to be turned down for really anything. Deep down he knew some of that had to do with his class, but he was nevertheless proud of what he had done and was never afraid to flaunt it. It’s called being confident, not egotistical. 

Perhaps one of the Pariah would know what was wrong with the die, or at least teach Theo what the hell to do with it. And once it was working, he could return to the Reliquary and rise up the ranks. Felix started the next Tuesday, which gave Theo the weekend and two days of the week if he was willing to skip out on school.

The doorbell rang. Theo sprang up from his desk, leaving the mirror behind. It was probably time for him to get up and get ready to go anyway. He had wasted the morning away thinking about what he wanted to do, and he knew he would pay for it later.

‘Vacant’ was the best word anyone could use to describe the house. With very little decoration, color, and a whole lot of openness, the only thing to fill the space was silence. It was very peaceful at times, but on the other hand it was eerily reminiscent of homes right before they’re bought. Just clean enough that they could be toured at any moment, and just enough personality to pass as a home instead of a house.

He had to lean down to take a glance through the peephole, but it was worth it to make sure Felix wasn’t at the door to continue bothering him. Making out the figure of a woman through the peephole, he decided it was safe to open up the door. As soon as Theo has cracked it open, the woman burst through the door, blurring past Theo.

“Didn’t expect you to be home so early, Mom.”

“No, I told you that I-“ she stopped to catch her breath for a moment and turned back towards Theo. “Nevermind, sorry, I couldn’t have told you, I was just stopping by to grab something and heading back out again.”

He started heading back up the stairs to his room. Still had to pack everything up. He was only able to make about halfway up the stairs before his mom called his name again. Could she not just respect the fact that he was busy at the moment? He begrudgingly made his way back downstairs, finding her in the kitchen. “What do you need now?”

She was rapidly opening and closing cupboards and drawers before landing at the spice drawer. “Um, have you seen Joel at all?”

“Oh yeah, he was just by.”

She grinned from ear to ear.

“I was joking Mom, of course Dad wasn’t here. What do you even expect from him at this point? He’s never home.” Theo shook his head, filled with an almost paternal disappointment.

His mom slammed the spice cabinet closed and went back to opening and closing drawers, ‘ignoring’ what her son had said. “Well, at least help out Julie this weekend,” she said, trying and failing to hide what effect Theo’s statement had on her. “She has exams coming up.”

“Sure thing Mom.”

It was Theo’s hypothesis that his parents had Julie a few years after Theo to make up for how he turned out. Julie was an eerily similar name to Joel as well. Arrogant bastard probably would’ve named his baby girl Joel if Mom wasn’t there to restrain him. At the very least, Theo benefitted from how little they were in the house this weekend. Wouldn’t even know he was gone, and if they did, they likely wouldn’t care.

Anyway, he was on a time limit. Before making his way upstairs again, he grabbed a steak knife from the kitchen. It took until he was already upstairs that he realized it would be somewhat difficult to place a knife in his backpack without harming anything else in said backpack. He decided it couldn’t hurt to try, and gently placed the knife down flat on the bottom of the bag. In the bag went two apples, a box of granola bars, a change of clothes, his wallet, and upon further thought, another knife.

Theo didn’t know much about Pariah territory, but it didn’t take a genius to know that what he normally wore would stand out. He snatched a black t-shirt and dark jeans out of his closet and began to rough them up. For some added authenticity, he took one of the knives from his bag and made cuts in both the jeans and shirt. He didn’t have time to figure out a better outfit, so this would have to make do. He took one last look at himself holding the die in the mirror before shoving it into his jeans. Nothing left he could do to prepare.

They might appreciate me leaving a note behind to tell them I’m leaving, he thought, his hand already on the doorknob. He chuckled to himself before opening the door and taking his first steps outside. There was payoff in waiting to say anything. In just a few days, he could surprise Joel with the news as his coworker at the Reliquary instead of just his son.


###Chapter Three
There was no fine line, wall, or border between the CGT and Pariah Territory. Instead, the atmosphere shifted near instantly from developed to developing. The bright colors of the CGT quickly turned to browns, greys, and a heavy helping of rust. Only owning a bike and valuing it too much to risk losing it, Theo had decided to take one of the commerce trains there. Lines ran over most of the city with the primary task of importing and exporting goods. Oftentimes there would be open spots on the trains, and space would be opened up to civilians. Tickets were cheap as it was relatively infrequent for people to transfer away from their home unless they had a very good reason to do so. From what Theo had learned in class, the Pariah shipped out primarily food and products from mining. They had perfected the art of farming underground, creating layers upon layers of crops underneath the city.

A siren blared, signaling that it was time for the passengers to get off. The train would only slow, not stop. Brakes squealed, Theo snatched his bag up off the ground, and ran to a large opening in the side of the traincar. He spotted a clearing coming up ahead at a railroad crossing and chose to jump there.

It was almost as if the Wild West were transported to present day. Buildings sat squat upon the ground as if they were hugging the Earth. Sidewalks melded with what would be the roads if there were any cars around. 10 minutes since he jumped and Theo had yet to see a single car or motorcycle, but plenty of people wandered the streets. There were some talking amongst each other, some sitting on street corners, and others merely entertaining themselves. Others looked like they were peddling wares. The dirt covered salesmen bounded across the street with oversized backpacks that towered over even their own heads. Maybe if I packed just a bit more I could have joined them, Theo thought to himself. As soon as the thought passed through his mind a weathered old woman tripped, causing the contents of her pack to spill out across the ground. On second thought, not my crowd.

It was only once Theo had arrived there that he realized he didn’t necessarily have a plan. Or a place to sleep that night. If the train had been on time, then he would have arrived just after 4. That allowed for around 3 or so hours of exploration before he had to figure out a place to sleep or a way to get back home fast.

He considered asking around about Relics but figured he looked conspicuous enough already. Those known as the Retainers walked the streets at all times, ‘managing’ people they believed would sour the land. This referred to any and all visitors. A few months back a girl from Theo’s class by the name of Bethany disappeared without notice. Word was that she had ran away from home seeking safety in a place away from less than friendly parents. When an emotionally distraught Bethany made it to this land of savages, she was supposedly found by the Retainers and promptly handled. That was at least the rumor, but it served well to remind him to blend in as best as possible.

Walking around or finding some gathering place was his best bet at gathering intel on the area before he investigated any deeper. A board rested on its side against a building labeled ‘Burial Buffet: You’ll eat so much we’ll have to bury ya!’. It was filled with flyers listing various news and opportunities:

BURIAL BUFFET BUTCHER NEEDED - 1 HOUR = 6$

New to Pariah? Watch out for Retainers!

See newcomers? Contact the Retainers!

Theo grinned at seeing those two signs directly next to each other.

Mallory Farms hiring - Fieldwork Experience and Comfortability in Claustrophobic Spaces Required

Bounty($100) - Dick Arbery - On account of giving Pariah secrets to Reliq.

Wouldn’t be terrible to come into a little bit of quick cash if he ran into this Mr. Arbery.

RECRUITING PARIAN SOLDIERS - RELICS PROVIDED - 447 MUDRED ST

Well that just seemed convenient. Theo could pop in, learn how to use that damn dice, and return to the Reliquary with information on the rebels. Easy wins all around. He ripped down the flyer and made his way to his new destination.

Shabby. Rundown. It had taken a full two hours to get to the street, not to mention trying to find the building once he got there. Buildings and houses were numbered out of order and addresses were oftentimes scattered on the ground collecting dust. 447 Mudred Street was a small ranch home with only a curtain to be used as an entrance. Above the curtain was a tilted sign welcoming applicants. It was only now, hours and miles into this endeavor, that Theo considered that this may not have been his brightest idea. And yet, without pause, he walked into 447 Mudred Street.

The curtain was pulled back, revealing a man who appeared to be in his early forties. He sat at a wooden table, playing some card game by himself while flies buzzed around his head. The man smacked the table with his right hand. Cards flew into the air and his long white hair swayed in front of his battered face. Behind him stood two women, one considerably taller than the other. Where the tall blonde looked upright and confident, the bronze skinned girl with curly dark hair looked less so. Her khaki pants transitioned smoothly into the top of an army uniform that seemed just a little too big for her. On the right side of the chest was the word ‘AMBER’ stitched in red. On second glance, Theo thought that she might be as tall as the blonde if she stopped hunkering over for just a moment.

Theo cleared his throat. “Excuse me sir.” At that, the smaller girl rolled her eyes and snatched up a phone from the table. “I’m here to… Can I apply to be a rebel here?”

“Ah, of course!” the man said in a much more jovial voice than any outsider could have expected, “We’ll always take new members! Come, come, have a seat.”

Without any hint of outside help, a chair from underneath the table whipped around to behind Theo and dashed back to the table, forcing him to sit opposite the man. Odd, but no one else there seemed to mind so it would probably be best if he didn’t either.

“Before we get started and I’m initiated into this wonderful movement of yours, I know you guys are huge fans of Relics,” Theo mused, “Mind filling me in a bit on those?”

The tiny one left the room with the phone to her ear. The blonde girl sneered and followed right behind. Those were the types of personalities Theo had expected when he came here, not what this older gentleman had been acting like.

The cards flew together into one almost perfect stack on the table. “My, my, Mr. Hargreaves, I wasn’t expecting such a fun question this late in the day! Any particular aspect you would like to know more about?” He wagged a wrinkled little finger at Theo. “Remember I’m only telling you this in exchange for your help.”

Theo pretended to think for a moment, squeezing the dice in his pocket. “So, if I happened to have one, how would I go about using it?”

“You are not a very subtle boy Mr. Hargreaves! Do you know what strand of Relic you may or may not be in possession of?”

“Strand?”

“Oh my! You really do know very little!” he bellowed. “Come here boy, show me what you have.”

Once again the chair whipped Theo around, this time to sit closer to the man. Reluctantly, Theo grabbed out the dice and held it flat on his palm in the direction of the man. He snatched not the dice, but the hand that held it. “Manipulation,” he crooned, “Most assuredly not your specialty.”

“I still don’t know how to use it.” Theo sighed, “Got anything to help with that?”

“Ah! Education these days, they leave out the good stuff. Somewhere in that teensy tiny little chest of yours,” he poked Theo right in the sternum, “there’s a little bit of energy washing around. There are different names for it; the Waves, the Gears, the Machinations, or as we call it, the Flow. Every person you have ever met has some type of flow inside of them, some ocean beating inside them. These Relics that you see? They have a similar flow inside of them, said to be bestowed upon them by the Earth itself.”

Theo was growing impatient and restless. He found himself focusing on the ceiling more than the man’s words.

“-tap into that flow, connect to the Relic, and make sure not to stir up too much conflict,” he finished off, laughing as if he had made some joke. Honestly, he might have and Theo was just too zoned out to notice.

Finally Theo had been presented with an opportunity to speak. “Last thing, how will I know when it’s working? How can I use it?”

“Your Manipulation is very subtle, Mr. Hargreaves. If you truly wish it so, I may expedite the process and tell you what you are able to do with this die.”

“For the love of Pariah, please skip to that point.”

“It may stunt your ability to grow in relation with Relics in the future, and we prefer that not happen to our fighters, Mr. Hargreaves.”

“I won’t join you unless you tell me.”

The old man sighed, and Theo’s chair slid back to its original place at the table opposite him. “I suppose it wouldn’t hurt too much to know. Yours is a hard one to control, though I can sense you’ve used it on accident once before. Slight emotional control. Where you’re at right now, the people around you feel the same emotions you do when you’re frustrated or ecstatic, the two ends of the emotional scale.”

Theo thought back to when he might have used it before. It clicked. Applying at the Reliquary. He got frustrated when he believed the Relic wasn’t working, and the interviewer, in her newfound frustrated state, shooed him away. Huh. No more reason to stay here he supposed. With the way timing had worked, he could probably make it back to a train by sundown, and be back in bed before midnight. The next day, he would show up at the Reliquary, newfound mastery over his power, and info on the location of a rebel recruitment center. He stood up to leave and began to walk towards the curtain.

“Mr. Hargreaves, will you not stay and learn more about how you can help us fight back against the Reliquary?”

“I need to get some rest for the time being, but I can give you my phone number if you want.” At that the man eagerly nodded. “800-352-4477. I’ll be seeing you later.”

He was only steps out the door before he heard the crunch of metal against his right knee. He keeled over in pain, lying on his side upon the street. Looking up, he saw two dark figures with the telltale markings of Retainers. Rusted metal suits with a small red lapel adorning the right shoulder. As he laid there on the ground and a metal boot approached his stomach, he had only one curious thought. He had never told the old man his last name was Hargreaves.


###Chapter Four
Amber readjusted her stance next to Eve. Being practically born into the rebels had its perks, though menial tasks such as this were certainly not included. When Amber had first been assigned here, Eve had been smug about it. That smugness was noticed by officials which promptly landed her there as well. Supposedly, Eve was sent as ‘offensive support’, but that was purely to help her ego. There was nothing to ‘offend’ against here. They were tasked with watching over a local recruitment center through the next week’s end. The elderly man that worked there seemed a tad bit senile, but he apparently knew quite a bit about relics and seeing the potential of someone’s future. Likewise, Amber was sent due to her ability to gather information in a unique fashion.

Those were long days standing next to Eve. Eve found ways to provoke her that would go unnoticed by Dr. Leopold. Though, it wasn’t so hard to do things behind his back with how engrossed he became in Solitaire as soon as the cards were laid out. She would send small sparks through her fingertips into Amber’s back. Amber knew her relic allowed her to take her frustration out without consequences, even if it would be a waste of Flow. This wouldn’t stop fantasizing about it.

Two days in and only four visitors as of yet. Four times she’s had to run an impromptu background check, which they all passed. Two were raised in Pariah land, one in the untouched zone, and the last had been moving all their life. All willing to risk their lives to bring down the Reliquary. Background checks were so exceptionally unnecessary here. Many times before, Amber had thought about convincing the higher ups to give her something to do that had some meaning. She had always backed down when she thought how difficult it would be to actually explain her power. Even she barely understood it and she’d been tinkering with it for years.

It was around 19:00 on a Saturday when the 5th visitor arrived. It was a tad late, but the Pariahs ran on a different schedule anyway. One foot through the door was all the signal necessary for Amber to get to work. She reached into the pocket of her khaki pants and grabbed out a stopwatch. Once it started, she’d have roughly 3 minutes to get what she needed if she wanted to conserve Flow. Time to begin.

Click

She charged the boy, knocking him to the ground. On the way down his left arm banged against the doorway. Now she would definitely have to listen to the time limit to keep him safe. He yelled out in pain. She rolled him over and wrenched his injured arm behind his back, pushing down. Eve and Dr. Leopold stood by.

Tick

Thirty seconds had passed. Amber brought her hand to her hip, making sure her relic was still there. Sure enough, the pocket sized book hung on a thin silver chain wrapped around her belt. Back to work.

“Your name?”

The boy groaned. Sweat was already visibly accumulating on the side of his face, dripping towards his wavy blonde hair.

She twisted his arm back more. “I’ll ask again. Your name?”

“The-Theo Hargreaves!”

Tock

She could swear she had heard the name Hargreaves somewhere before. “Why are you here?”

“Obviously to work with the rebels!”

Amber planted her knee on Theo’s upper back, pushing down. “Why are you really here?”

Theo gasped to breathe, smacking the ground with the full of his right arm. Colloquially, that generally meant surrender. It always seemed to weigh on Amber when she ended up actually hurting people in this state. She relaxed her stance over him, letting him take in a breath of air.

Tick

“Listen, I just want to know something about this relic I have and I thought you would know,” Theo said, a bit of drool rolling down from his mouth.

Normally that lack of commitment would be immediate cause to send him away, but seeing as she still had a bit of time on the clock, she could ask more.

Tock

“Where did you come from? I know you’re not from Pariah Territory.”

“I live over near the Reliquary,” he declared, “I promise you that, I think I have some ID in my bag to prove it.”

Tick

Time was running out. She had time for one more question. She thought for a moment, not sure what to land on. “What’s your father’s name?”

Amber could see him squint his eyes in confusion, but he answered nonetheless. “Joel.”

If anything, she knew why the name was familiar. She couldn’t comprehend why the son of a Reliquary executive would leave their precious little bubble to come here, but that was irrelevant.

Click

Time was up. Touching the tome at her side, she felt her vision expand across another dimension. Almost as if she were flicking through a powerpoint, she could see snapshots of moments of the recent past. Further back images were more faded and harder to latch onto. She found the moment just before the stopwatch was clicked and latched on. The world shifted around her as she watched the previous 3 minutes pass in reverse through the eyes of her own body. Her knee was lifted off of Theo’s back, they were back on their feet again. She ran backwards next to Eve, and Theo was back outside of the doorway again. Time resumed as it should. No one would remember any of this besides Amber.

Theo walked inside with a rigid body. He paused for a moment taking in everything in the room, and cleared his throat. “Excuse me sir,” he said, facing Dr. Leopold. Amber rolled her eyes. The nerve that boy must have to come in here acting all polite. The rebels would earn brownie points with the Retainers if they were the ones to call Theo in. Amber went to the table and snatched up her phone. As she left the room towards the kitchen she could hear Theo and Dr. Leopold discussing particulars that she paid no mind to.

For being a shabby place, the kitchen was at least nice enough. She used the island to support her body weight as she began typing in the Retainer contact info. Eve sulked around to the other side of the kitchen and opened her mouth to speak. “You should be in there watching Harvey.”

“It’s Dr. Leopold, and shouldn’t your ‘offensive support’ be enough, Eve?” As much as Amber would love to have riled up Eve in that moment, using so much Flow had drained her of any energy. She was exhausted. “Actually, can you do me a favor and call this guy into the Retainers?”

Lines etched themselves into Eve’s forehead as her voice lowered, “Did you do your whole ‘no consequences’ shtick?” The way she said ‘no consequences’ mirrored the way Amber had talked about her offensive support.

“Turns out the kid is the son of one Mr. Joel Hargreaves.”

Eve chuckled quietly, “Of course he is. Even the way he walked in here reeked of them.”

“Anyway,” Amber muttered, sliding her phone over to Eve, “I need to go rest. Please call them before he leaves.”

Eve nodded and picked up the phone. Leaving the kitchen was a small room, no bigger than a closet, with three stacked beds inside. Each bed was made neat and orderly, courtesy of Dr. Leopold. It amazed her that the man could act so brazen and eccentric yet take the time every morning to tidy up. She climbed up to the upper bunk and collapsed on the bed. It would take only a few hours for her Flow to recharge, but she might as well sleep through the night to prepare for another day like this one.
