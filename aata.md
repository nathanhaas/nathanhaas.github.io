**NOTE:** This was written with the intention to be made into a video. As I worked on it, I repeatedly found out that I didn't have the energy to fight OBS into recording bits of this movie, that software and Amazon's privacy rules got hands. Hence the occasional notes in this that would indicate a video. Audio has been recorded, which may one day be turned into a video, but I just want to move on from this. I did make the opening to make fun of the movie, and I liked that part. Anyway, Anna and the Apocalypse.

I took the last final of one of the hardest semesters of my life on December 8th, 2020. I still had a paper left for a class on ancient medicine, but I could put that off at least a little bit. I had chosen to write about the impact, or lack thereof, of pandemic narratives on actual medical practice. Watching 28 Days Later seemed alright enough for the paper, but being the foolish, stubborn person I am, I searched for more. I very quickly stumbled across an article listing pandemic movies that someone had watched in light of COVID. Contagion seemed too on the nose, I had already seen Train to Busan a hundred times, The Stand seemed like too much of a commitment to even find. I was getting restless; I wanted something interesting. Only moments later would the gods from above smite me for wearing my hubris on my sleeve. But I didn’t know that. And there it was. Anna And The Apocalypse. The godforsaken fever dream; free to consume on Amazon Prime!

Anna And The Apocalypse is a zombie, high school, comedy, Christmas, Shaun of the Dead inspired….. Musical. I’m genuinely unsure what genre exactly pushed me over the edge, but I know that watching it is a surreal experience I would recommend to anyone. If you don’t want to know anything else about the movie, I recommend stopping the video here and then coming back.

There is,,, so much I want to talk about in regards to this movie but I only have the attention span for a few things. I’m going to quickly go through the plot of the movie and then zero in on what’s really interesting to me. I’m just now realizing that I’m going to have to watch this movie again and take notes this time.

[Plot with background video being clips from movie, just gonna ad-lib this, expand on tonal shift briefly, exclude what happens once they arrive at the high school]

If you watched this movie, it would be pretty obvious just how much inspiration the creators took from Shaun of the Dead, another genre mashup zombie movie. From the interspersed jump cut sequences, to the whole musical sequence where Anna sings through the city turning to… zombies. Shaun of the Dead also has the infamous pub scene where the characters correctly foreshadow the remaining events of the movie. Anna And The Apocalypse does the same, though through the song “Hollywood Ending”. The song emphasises that there are no happy endings, which is honestly just a boring thing to put at the start of a zombie Christmas musical.

Excuse me while I go off the edge a bit here and talk about how different pandemic narratives treat humanity. From the beginning of 28 Days Later, the movie focuses on the people involved in a pandemic. Like many fictional narratives, it has a defined protagonist and cast of characters that the audience is supposed to care about. 28 Days Later tackles the lack of honor in a pandemic from a much grittier, cinematic angle. For the last 20 minutes of this zombie outbreak movie, only one zombie is shown. The focus shifts to fighting between humans in the wake of this outbreak. The climactic action moments intentionally portray the protagonist, Jim, the same way that zombies were portrayed earlier in the film, with little lighting, quick cuts, and shaky camera angles as he kills many people he was working with only moments ago. One of the other main characters even thinks that the protagonist, Jim, has become a zombie themselves.

Turning to a historical narrative of a pandemic, we can take a look at Thucydides’ account of the Athenian Plague during the fifth century BC. For the majority of his writings, Thucydides’ account strictly states facts that Thucydides has observed. In this way, Thucydides’ account of the Athenian Plague is very similar to how someone in the medical profession today might keep a record of a disease outbreak. 

The most obvious example of Thucydides’ account turning away from an objective medicinal record is as follows: “Perseverance in what men called honor was popular with none, it was so uncertain whether they would be spared to attain the object…”. Very simply, Thucydides is describing how men lost even their honor during this pandemic because of how unlikely it would be that they could even survive long enough to regain it. He continues by stating plainly that the plague had an emotional impact on the citizens, “Such was the nature of the calamity, and heavily did it weigh on the Athenians.” 

For both 28 Days Later and Thucydides’ Account, their last third almost strictly focuses on the humanity involved in a pandemic rather than the disease itself, adding depth to the accounts as a whole. 

And then there’s Anna And The Apocalypse. The last act of the movie sees the main cast of characters return to their high school to find the principal being evil antagonist 2000. In short, he locks the characters in a room with their parents that he turned into zombies(for some reason that is never truly clarified other than to be evil), and he sings a little diddy. While Savage, the principal, is phenomenally evil, he seems to be giving the message that I’m almost sure the writers believe through this song. For lack of a better word, he raps the line: “Always talking, texting, tweeting every thought that’s in your vacuous heads”, followed by, “I’ve been calling you all zombies for years”. This is reminiscent of a few lines in an earlier song, “Human Voice”. There, every character sings together about needing their human voice. This seems relatively normal enough for a song at the midpoint of the film, right before where an intermission would be in a theater production. However, the song once again looks towards technology as a point of meaning. 
- “Staring at a screen in a neon haze”
- “Lost in this machine and I can’t engage”
- “We’ve become technology made of code and binary, what the hell is left of me”
- “How much longer must I wait, I want to communicate”
- “Someday we’ll talk in that old fashioned way”
The last line here is only included in the festival cut as far as I know, but I find it interesting that that cut had even more of this message included. The message, whatever it may be, is so heavily hammered into a song named after humanity, that it’s hard to not see the connection the writers are trying to draw here.

On top of all that(cut to 34:40 #evacselfie), it seems that the writers have decided the human aspect of their pandemic narrative to be based around technology. This seems off as at no point in the movie is it explained why exactly phones might be bad. They’re called a detriment by both the pro and antagonists, leaving the watcher confused as to what even point of it all is. Humanity is a central aspect to near all pandemic narratives. It provides life and purpose to a genre that would otherwise be devoid of it. Anna and the Apocalypse lacks this in a unique way. It attempts to fuse humanity into the story through song, dance, and jokes, but lacks a meaning behind any of it. This would be perfectly okay if they didn’t attempt a meaning, but they did, and it flopped.

Before this ends, a lightning round of things I wish I had the motivation to go into:
- The lighting is weird EVERYWHERE except for the last 4 minutes when they’re about to die
- The song by Ben and his boys about being a soldier at war slaps more than it should
- The one very sexual song in the first act of the movie that doesn’t really have a purpose outside of making the principal a curmudgeon. The curmudgeon bit does contrast the literal mass murder later though. Good song.
- I feel like I’m going insane but so much of this is Shaun of the Dead that it almost hurts
- No one actually experiences character development. Their goals experience development, like Anna changing from wanting to go to Australia, to wanting to find her father, to wanting to survive, but that’s the extent of it. And that is very boring.
- I REALLY wanted to talk about the implications of “Hollywood Ending” having a contrived meaning much like the themes of technology do, but I value my sanity far too much. Just know that saying everyone is going to die and no one will be happy and then everyone dying and no one being happy isn’t creative or out of the norm, it’s just silly and makes you go “damn…. I don’t care”.
- And of course I have to recognize the pun made by the only enjoyable character to spend time with at 33:20 (**Note**: I completely forget what this pun was but I now feel compelled to rewatch the film to find out)

That’s all I got. I regret this being where I shove my energy into but here we are. Sleep well tonight y’all.
