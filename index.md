## Welcome to the dump zone

This is not a portfolio or a blog or a resume, but more of a space for me to save things that I've done that make me feel productive. And to serve as encouragement for myself to continue doing productive things. It's currently quite empty, and it will likely stay that way.

Oceanum:

Actually my first experience with using Github Pages after experiencing the pain that is anything other than Markdown, Oceanum was an experiment with writing a web serial in the vein of John C. Mccrae and the like. Long story short, I don't particularly enjoy writing quickly and not having much time to plan between chapters. Only made it 4 chapters in before deciding I didn't like it much but I did learn a good bit about designing magic systems, writing downtime, planning a plot, and so on. I'm happy to set this down, and looking forward to the next time I get a bug up my butt and feel like delving into fiction again.
